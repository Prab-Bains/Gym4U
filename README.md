## Project Overview
 Due to lack of accessibility and rising costs of gyms, we are creating an alternate way to find workout locations, that is a platform to allow users to 
 rent time in hosted home gyms.

 ## Missing Features
 Since we short on time we were unable to incorporate a couple features into our app. Some features include a map to show where the listed gyms are.
 Also, we currently do not have available time slots on the gym overview page. If we had time we would link our appointments page to only show 
 appointments that are available at a particular gym.
